    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Blini are a traditional dish of Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian cuisine, and one of the most commonly eaten foods in Russia. They are a type of yeast dough pancake that is typically made from wheat or buckwheat flour. In the West, blini typically
        refers to a small, savoury pancake that is made with a leavened batter, usually about 5 – 10 cm long. In Russia and Ukraine, however, blinis are usually pan-sized, thinner pancakes made from unleavened batter, similar to crepes. Blini are sometimes
        spelled as bliny, and can be referred to as ‘blin’, as in the singular form of blini. Due to their round shape, blini were considered to be a symbol of the sun in pre-Christian times. The East Slavic people would cook and eat blini at the end
        of winter, to mark the return of the sun (otherwise known as butter week or pancake week). This tradition is still practiced today.
