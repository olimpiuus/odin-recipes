    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Blini are a traditional dish of Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian cuisine, and one of the most commonly eaten foods in Russia. They are a type of yeast dough pancake that is typically made from wheat or buckwheat flour. In the West, blini typically
        refers to a small, savoury pancake that is made with a leavened batter, usually about 5 – 10 cm long. In Russia and Ukraine, however, blinis are usually pan-sized, thinner pancakes made from unleavened batter, similar to crepes. Blini are sometimes
        spelled as bliny, and can be referred to as ‘blin’, as in the singular form of blini. Due to their round shape, blini were considered to be a symbol of the sun in pre-Christian times. The East Slavic people would cook and eat blini at the end
        of winter, to mark the return of the sun (otherwise known as butter week or pancake week). This tradition is still practiced today.

            To make the Blini shells the first step is to mix the dry ingredients(flour & sugar).Beat eggs well, Add milk to eggs. Then add to dry ingredients a little at a time, beating well. Batter will be smooth like pancake batter. Using a 7 inch skillet that
            has been lightly oiled/sprayed, pour thin layer of batter to cover bottom of pan. Fry till light in color, frying only the one side. Remove to a plate to cool before filling

        <li>To make cheese filling place all the filling ingredients(cheese, eggs & sugar) in a blender or food processor & mix well. ****You can also fill the shells with Applesauce, Apricot, Prune or Poppyseed filling as well. </li>
        <li>
            To make Blini, place a shell on a cutting board or counter top. Place about 2 tablespoons of filling into the center of the non fried side and spread evenly creating a line in that center leaving about an inch at each end. Roll over until log forms and
            place in a buttered baking dish.(Be careful not to over lap the Blini) Take a spoon & run the back of the spoon through the sour cream and then spread a thin layer evenly over top of each Blini. Now Place a few pats of butter over top the
            prepared Blini Pan, then sprinkle with cinnamon & lightly dust with powdered sugar. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm & enjoy
